# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-02)

**Core value:** Turn the ecosystem's headless service APIs into one usable, observable operator surface — see and act on what the backends are doing from a single web UI.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Foundation

Phase: 1 of 6 (Foundation)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Stack fixed by research — React 19 + Vite SPA (TanStack Router/Query + shadcn/ui + Tailwind v4, TS pinned 5.9.x) served as static assets behind a thin Go `httputil.ReverseProxy` BFF in this repo.
- [Roadmap]: SSE via `@microsoft/fetch-event-source` (endpoints are SSE-over-POST; native EventSource unusable).
- [Roadmap]: Vertical-slice build order — Memory (REST-only) deliberately before Flow (first SSE) to de-risk auth/cache before the keystone streaming risk.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1]: BFF-03 SSE pass-through is the keystone risk — must be an explicit acceptance gate (curl -N + browser through a real proxy with compression on) before any streaming UI.
- [Phase 3]: Flag for phase-specific research — verify BFF SSE-flush/heartbeat against the actual deploy proxy; confirm flowd/chat heartbeat behavior and flowd resume vs. separate `/replay`.
- [Phase 6]: Verify umbrella fronting proxy/LB (buffering, gzip, idle timeout) against SSE routes; environment-specific.
